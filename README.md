## About Me

I am a portfolio manager and quantitative developer, currently leading the development of Quant Journeyâ€”an industry-grade package for funds and professional investors. My expertise lies at the intersection of a physics degree, advanced informatics experience, and deep knowledge of the stock market.

**Core Competencies:**
- Portfolio management & systematic trading
